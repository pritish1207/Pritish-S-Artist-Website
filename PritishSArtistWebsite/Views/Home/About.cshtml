Working primarily in FL Studio and skilled with the Novation Launchpad, Pritish crafts immersive soundscapes that blend house, deep house, and afro house with cinematic, modern atmospheres.

            Inspired by his father, the legendary MK, KSHMR, and Travis Scott, Pritish draws on a wide range of influences. His father’s radio station, <b>Classic Central Radio</b>, has been a major source of inspiration, fueling his love for music and the art of storytelling through sound. Always striving to learn and evolve, Pritish is known for his creativity and his relentless pursuit of new techniques and ideas.
